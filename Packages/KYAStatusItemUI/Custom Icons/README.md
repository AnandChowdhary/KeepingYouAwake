# Using Custom Icons

KeepingYouAwake 1.2.2beta2 and newer allows the use of custom icons.

## Usage

Just place four images named `ActiveIcon.png`, `ActiveIcon@2x.png`, `InactiveIcon.png`, `InactiveIcon@2x.png` in your `~/Library/Containers/info.marcel-dierkes.KeepingYouAwake/Data/Documents` folder. The optimal size for these images is 22x20 points.

> Older versions (< 1.5.0) without App Sandbox support require the icons to be located in `~/Library/Application Support/KeepingYouAwake/`.
