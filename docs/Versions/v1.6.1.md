# Version 1.6.1: Notifications

- added support for notifications, use `System Preferences` to manage notification settings ([#164](https://github.com/newmarcel/KeepingYouAwake/pull/164))
  - please note, this feature is only available on macOS 11 or newer; the previous experimental notifications support has been removed
- updated the French translation ([#146](https://github.com/newmarcel/KeepingYouAwake/issues/146), [#169](https://github.com/newmarcel/KeepingYouAwake/pull/169))
