# Version 1.6.4: Ventura Login Items and URL Scheme Fix

- shows in the "Login Items" > "Open at Login" section in System Settings on macOS Ventura if "Start at Login" is enabled
- fixes a regression introduced in 1.6.3 where the `keepingyouawake:///activate` URL scheme stopped working as expected ([#193](https://github.com/newmarcel/KeepingYouAwake/issues/193))
